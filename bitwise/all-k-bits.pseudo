ENUMERATE ALL STRINGS OF k BITS OF LENGTH n

S = (1 << k) - 1
while S < (1 << N):
	# Use S

	if S == 0: break # Handle case when k = 0

	low_order_bit = S & -S;
	carried = S + low_order_bit
	carry_portion = S ^ carried
	shifted = carry_portion / low_order_bit / 4
	S = carried | shifted

IN SHORT FORM

S = (1 << k) - 1
while S < (1 << N):
	# Use S

	if S == 0: break
	a = S & -S; b = S + a
	S = (S ^ b) / 4 / a | b
